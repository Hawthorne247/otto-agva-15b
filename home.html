        <h2>Welcome to Nora's Nook</h2>
        
        <p>At Nora’s Nook, the pace is intentionally unhurried. Sunlight drifts through the windows in the early hours, catching the edges of freshly baked scones and the swirl of steamed milk rising from the barista’s counter. Families often wander in with weekend ease, children choosing a treat from the pastry case while parents settle into the cushioned corners that give the shop its name. It’s the kind of place where regulars greet each other by name and newcomers are met with a smile that feels like an invitation.
        </p>
        <p>The shop’s shelves are dotted with well-loved novels, local art, and the occasional handwritten note left behind by past visitors. Students, freelancers, and dreamers often claim a cozy table for an afternoon, finding that the gentle soundtrack of quiet chatter and clinking cups makes the perfect backdrop for getting things done. Nora’s Nook thrives on these small, human moments—reading, chatting, working—and has become a little haven where community grows naturally, one cup and one conversation at a time.
